    "Q1. What is an Exception in python? Write the difference between exceptions and syntax errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans : An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. \n",
    "      When an exceptional situation arises, an exception object is raised, which can be caught and handled by appropriate code.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Exceptions are a way of handling errors and other exceptional situations in a more controlled and structured manner. They allow you to\n",
    "       write code that gracefully handles unexpected situations and provides appropriate error messages or takes corrective actions.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    - On the other hand, syntax errors are a type of error that occur when the Python interpreter encounters invalid code that violates the\n",
    "       rules of the Python language syntax. Syntax errors typically prevent the code from being executed at all. Examples of syntax errors \n",
    "        include misspelling a keyword, missing a closing parenthesis, or using incorrect indentation.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    Q: Write the difference between exceptions and syntax errors.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. Occurrence: Exceptions occur during the execution of a program when a specific exceptional situation arises. Syntax errors, on the\n",
    "        other hand, occur before the execution of the program when the code violates the syntax rules of the Python language.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    2. Handling: Exceptions can be caught and handled using exception handling mechanisms like try-except blocks. This allows you to gracefully\n",
    "       handle exceptional situations and take appropriate actions. Syntax errors cannot be caught and handled in the same way because they prevent\n",
    "        the code from being executed at all. They need to be fixed by correcting the code.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    3. Impact: Exceptions disrupt the normal flow of the program but can be handled to prevent the program from terminating abruptly. Syntax errors,\n",
    "       on the other hand, prevent the program from being executed altogether until the errors are fixed."
